@import "bootstrap";

// I placed this bootstrap import here so our custom CSS classes would override Bootstrap's classes.
// This file is loaded first in the asset pipeline.
// The pipeline loads CSS files numerically first then alphabetically. Now that our custom CSS files come
// after this one they will override bootstrap without having to use !important (which is dangerous).
