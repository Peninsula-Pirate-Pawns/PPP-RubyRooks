# Peninsula Pirate Pawns

This web application is a simple game of chess with a pirate theme. Our Agile team members all resided in Florida at the time we came together to make this project so we found it fitting to have an ocean related theme. Make an account, join or create a game and flex your strategic thinking muscles!

## Gem highlights

### Devise

This project uses Devise for user registration, authentication, and validation. You can read more about Devise on their [github.](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)

### Omniauth

The sign-in page relies on omniauth for users to create an account or sign in to an existing account via a third party.
